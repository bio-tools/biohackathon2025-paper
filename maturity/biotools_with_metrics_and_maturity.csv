go_feat,fabriciopa,gofeat,"Downstream analysis of genomic and transcriptomic sequence data is often executed by functional annotation that can be performed by various bioinformatics tools and biological databases. However, a full fast integrated tool is not available for such analysis. Besides, the current available software is not able to produce analytic lists of annotations and graphs to help users in evaluating the output results. Therefore, we present the Gene Ontology Functional Enrichment Annotation Tool (GO FEAT), a free web platform for functional annotation and enrichment of genomic and transcriptomic data based on sequence homology search. The analysis can be customized and visualized as per users' needs and specifications. GO FEAT is freely available at http://computationalbiology.ufpa.br/gofeat/ and its source code is hosted at https://github.com/fabriciopa/gofeat.",17.0,17.0,2.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,2.0,0.0,35.0,1.0,90.005,None

epimutacions,isglobal-brge,epimutacionsShiny),"Epimutations are rare alterations of the normal DNA methylation pattern at specific loci, which can lead to rare diseases. Methylation microarrays enable genome-wide epimutation detection, but technical limitations prevent their use in clinical settings: methods applied to rare diseases’ data cannot be easily incorporated to standard analyses pipelines, while epimutation methods implemented in R packages (ramr) have not been validated for rare diseases. We have developed epimutacions, a Bioconductor package (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/epimutacions.html). epimutacions implements two previously reported methods and four new statistical approaches to detect epimutations, along with functions to annotate and visualize epimutations. Additionally, we have developed an user-friendly Shiny app to facilitate epimutations detection (https://github.com/isglobal-brge/epimutacionsShiny) to non-bioinformatician users. We first compared the performance of epimutacions and ramr packages using three public datasets with experimentally validated epimutations. Methods in epimutacions had a high performance at low sample sizes and outperformed methods in ramr. Second, we used two general population children cohorts (INMA and HELIX) to determine the technical and biological factors that affect epimutations detection, providing guidelines on how designing the experiments or preprocessing the data. In these cohorts, most epimutations did not correlate with detectable regional gene expression changes. Finally, we exemplified how epimutacions can be used in a clinical context. We run epimutacions in a cohort of children with autism disorder and identified novel recurrent epimutations in candidate genes for autism. Overall, we present epimutacions a new Bioconductor package for incorporating epimutations detection to rare disease diagnosis and provide guidelines for the design and data analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

suns,godotgildor,Suns,"Protein designers use a wide variety of software tools for de novo design, yet their repertoire still lacks a fast and interactive all-atom search engine. To solve this, we have built the Suns program: a real-time, atomic search engine integrated into the PyMOL molecular visualization system. Users build atomic-level structural search queries within PyMOL and receive a stream of search results aligned to their query within a few seconds. This instant feedback cycle enables a new ""designability""-inspired approach to protein design where the designer searches for and interactively incorporates native-like fragments from proven protein structures. We demonstrate the use of Suns to interactively build protein motifs, tertiary interactions, and to identify scaffolds compatible with hot-spot residues. The official web site and installer are located at http://www.degradolab.org/suns/ and the source code is hosted at https://github.com/godotgildor/Suns (PyMOL plugin, BSD license), https://github.com/Gabriel439/suns-cmd (command line client, BSD license), and https://github.com/Gabriel439/sunssearch (search engine server, GPLv2 license).",3.0,3.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,109.0,7.0,,None

dfast,nigyta,dfast-core,"We developed a prokaryotic genome annotation pipeline, DFAST, that also supports genome submission to public sequence databases. DFAST was originally started as an on-line annotation server, and to date, over 7000 jobs have been processed since its first launch in 2016. Here, we present a newly implemented background annotation engine for DFAST, which is also available as a standalone command-line program. The new engine can annotate a typical-sized bacterial genome within 10 min, with rich information such as pseudogenes, translation exceptions and orthologous gene assignment between given reference genomes. In addition, the modular framework of DFAST allows users to customize the annotation workflow easily and will also facilitate extensions for new functions and incorporation of new tools in the future. Availability and implementation The software is implemented in Python 3 and runs in both Python 2.7 and 3.4 - on Macintosh and Linux systems. It is freely available at https://github.com/nigyta/dfast-core/under the GPLv3 license with external binaries bundled in the software distribution. An on-line version is also available at https://dfast.nig.ac.jp/. Contact yn@nig.ac.jp Supplementary informationSupplementary dataare available at Bioinformatics online.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

htssip,buckleylab,HTSSIP,"Combining high throughput sequencing with stable isotope probing (HTS-SIP) is a powerful method for mapping in situ metabolic processes to thousands of microbial taxa. However, accurately mapping metabolic processes to taxa is complex and challenging. Multiple HTSSIP data analysis methods have been developed, including high-resolution stable isotope probing (HR-SIP), multi-window high-resolution stable isotope probing (MW-HR-SIP), quantitative stable isotope probing (qSIP), and ΔBD. Currently, there is no publicly available software designed specifically for analyzing HTS-SIP data. To address this shortfall, we have developed the HTSSIP R package, an open-source, cross-platform toolset for conducting HTS-SIP analyses in a straightforward and easily reproducible manner. The HTSSIP package, along with full documentation and examples, is available from CRAN at https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/HTSSIP/index.html and Github at https://github.com/buckleylab/HTSSIP.",3.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,1.0,6.0,5.0,0.0,193.0,7.0,40.979,None

scrat,zji90,SCRAT,"Summary: Emerging single-cell technologies (e.g. single-cell ATAC-seq, DNase-seq or ChIP-seq) have made it possible to assay regulome of individual cells. Single-cell regulome data are highly sparse and discrete. Analyzing such data is challenging. User-friendly software tools are still lacking. We present SCRAT, a Single-Cell Regulome Analysis Toolbox with a graphical user interface, for studying cell heterogeneity using single-cell regulome data. SCRAT can be used to conveniently summarize regulatory activities according to different features (e.g. gene sets, transcription factor binding motif sites, etc.). Using these features, users can identify cell subpopulations in a heterogeneous biological sample, infer cell identities of each subpopulation, and discover distinguishing features such as gene sets and transcription factors that show different activities among subpopulations. Availability and implementation: SCRAT is freely available at https://zhiji.shinyapps.io/scrat as an online web service and at https://github.com/zji90/SCRAT as an R package.",15.0,15.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,0.0,91.0,0.0,,None

toner,PavitaKae,ToNER,"Background Biochemical methods are available for enriching 5' ends of RNAs in prokaryotes, which are employed in the differential RNA-seq (dRNA-seq) and the more recent Cappable-seq protocols. Computational methods are needed to locate RNA 5' ends from these data by statistical analysis of the enrichment. Although statistical-based analysis methods have been developed for dRNA-seq, they may not be suitable for Cappable-seq data. The more efficient enrichment method employed in Cappable-seq compared with dRNA-seq could affect data distribution and thus algorithm performance. Results We present Transformation of Nucleotide Enrichment Ratios (ToNER), a tool for statistical modeling of enrichment from RNA-seq data obtained from enriched and unenriched libraries. The tool calculates nucleotide enrichment scores and determines the global transformation for fitting to the normal distribution using the Box-Cox procedure. From the transformed distribution, sites of significant enrichment are identified. To increase power of detection, meta-analysis across experimental replicates is offered. We tested the tool on Cappableseq and dRNA-seq data for identifying Escherichia coli transcript 5' ends and compared the results with those from the TSSAR tool, which is designed for analyzing dRNA-seq data. When combining results across Cappable-seq replicates, ToNER detects more known transcript 5' ends than TSSAR. In general, the transcript 5' ends detected by ToNER but not TSSAR occur in regions which cannot be locally modeled by TSSAR. Conclusion ToNER uses a simple yet robust statistical modeling approach, which can be used for detecting RNA 5'ends from Cappable-seq data, in particular when combining information from experimental replicates. The ToNER tool could potentially be applied for analyzing other RNA-seq datasets in which enrichment for other structural features of RNA is employed. The program is freely available for download at ToNER webpage (http://www4a. biotec.or.th/GI/tools/toner) and GitHub repository (https://github.com/PavitaKae/ToNER).",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,4.005,None

epinem,cbg-ethz,epiNEM,"Maps of genetic interactions can dissect functional redundancies in cellular networks. Gene expression profiles as high-dimensional molecular readouts of combinatorial perturbations provide a detailed view of genetic interactions, but can be hard to interpret if different gene sets respond in different ways (called mixed epistasis). Here we test the hypothesis that mixed epistasis between a gene pair can be explained by the action of a third gene that modulates the interaction. We have extended the framework of Nested Effects Models (NEMs), a type of graphical model specifically tailored to analyze high-dimensional gene perturbation data, to incorporate logical functions that describe interactions between regulators on downstream genes and proteins. We benchmark our approach in the controlled setting of a simulation study and show high accuracy in inferring the correct model. In an application to data from deletion mutants of kinases and phosphatases in S. cerevisiae we show that epistatic NEMs can point to modulators of genetic interactions. Our approach is implemented in the R-package ‘epiNEM’ available from https://github.com/cbg-ethz/epiNEM and https://bioconductor.org/packages/epiNEM/.",1.0,1.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,12.0,1.0,84.0,2.0,13.773,None

miic,miicTeam,MIIC,"Learning causal networks from large-scale genomic data remains challenging in absence of time series or controlled perturbation experiments. We report an information- theoretic method which learns a large class of causal or non-causal graphical models from purely observational data, while including the effects of unobserved latent variables, commonly found in many genomic datasets. Starting from a complete graph, the method iteratively removes dispensable edges, by uncovering significant information contributions from indirect paths, and assesses edge-specific confidences from randomization of available data. The remaining edges are then oriented based on the signature of causality in observational data. The approach and associated algorithm, miic, outperform earlier methods on a broad range of benchmark networks. Causal network reconstructions are presented at different biological size and time scales, from gene regulation in single cells to whole genome duplication in tumor development as well as long term evolution of vertebrates.

metacomp,pzhaipku,MetaComp,"Background: During the past decade, the development of high throughput nucleic sequencing and mass spectrometry analysis techniques have enabled the characterization of microbial communities through metagenomics, metatranscriptomics, metaproteomics and metabolomics data. To reveal the diversity of microbial communities and interactions between living conditions and microbes, it is necessary to introduce comparative analysis based upon integration of all four types of data mentioned above. Comparative meta-omics, especially comparative metageomics, has been established as a routine process to highlight the significant differences in taxon composition and functional gene abundance among microbiota samples. Meanwhile, biologists are increasingly concerning about the correlations between meta-omics features and environmental factors, which may further decipher the adaptation strategy of a microbial community. Results: We developed a graphical comprehensive analysis software named MetaComp comprising a series of statistical analysis approaches with visualized results for metagenomics and other meta-omics data comparison. This software is capable to read files generated by a variety of upstream programs. After data loading, analyses such as multivariate statistics, hypothesis testing of two-sample, multi-sample as well as two-group sample and a novel function-regression analysis of environmental factors are offered. Here, regression analysis regards meta-omic features as independent variable and environmental factors as dependent variables. Moreover, MetaComp is capable to automatically choose an appropriate two-group sample test based upon the traits of input abundance profiles. We further evaluate the performance of its choice, and exhibit applications for metagenomics, metaproteomics and metabolomics samples. Conclusion: MetaComp, an integrative software capable for applying to all meta-omics data, originally distills the influence of living environment on microbial community by regression analysis. Moreover, since the automatically chosen two-group sample test is verified to be outperformed, MetaComp is friendly to users without adequate statistical training. These improvements are aiming to overcome the new challenges under big data era for all meta-omics data. MetaComp is available at: http://cqb.pku.edu.cn/ZhuLab/MetaComp/ and https://github.com/pzhaipku/MetaComp/.",1.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,,None

jannovar,charite,jannovar.,"Transcript-based annotation and pedigree analysis are two basic steps in the computational analysis of whole-exome sequencing experiments in genetic diagnostics and disease-gene discovery projects. Here, we present Jannovar, a stand-alone Java application as well as a Java library designed to be used in larger software frameworks for exome and genome analysis. Jannovar uses an interval tree to identify all transcripts affected by a given variant, and provides Human Genome Variation Society-compliant annotations both for variants affecting coding sequences and splice junctions as well as untranslated regions and noncoding RNA transcripts. Jannovar can also perform family-based pedigree analysis with Variant Call Format (VCF) files with data from members of a family segregating a Mendelian disorder. Using a desktop computer, Jannovar requires a few seconds to annotate a typical VCF file with exome data. Jannovar is freely available under the BSD2 license. Source code as well as the Java application and library file can be downloaded from http://compbio.charite.de (with tutorial) and https://github.com/charite/jannovar. © 2014 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

oncotator,broadinstitute,oncotator).,"Oncotator is a tool for annotating genomic point mutations and short nucleotide insertions/deletions (indels) with variant- and gene-centric information relevant to cancer researchers. This information is drawn from 14 different publicly available resources that have been pooled and indexed, and we provide an extensible framework to add additional data sources. Annotations linked to variants range from basic information, such as gene names and functional classification (e.g. missense), to cancer-specific data from resources such as the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC), the Cancer Gene Census, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For local use, Oncotator is freely available as a python module hosted on Github (https://github.com/broadinstitute/oncotator).

neptune,phac-nml,neptune,"The ready availability of vast amounts of genomic sequence data has created the need to rethink comparative genomics algorithms using 'big data' approaches. Neptune is an efficient system for rapidly locating differentially abundant genomic content in bacterial populations using an exact k-mer matching strategy, while accommodating k-mer mismatches. Neptune's loci discovery process identifies sequences that are sufficiently common to a group of target sequences and sufficiently absent from nontargets using probabilistic models. Neptune uses parallel computing to efficiently identify and extract these loci from draft genome assemblies without requiring multiple sequence alignments or other computationally expensive comparative sequence analyses. Tests on simulated and real datasets showed that Neptune rapidly identifies regions that are both sensitive and specific. We demonstrate that this system can identify trait-specific loci from different bacterial lineages. Neptune is broadly applicable for comparative bacterial analyses, yet will particularly benefit pathogenomic applications, owing to efficient and sensitive discovery of differentially abundant genomic loci. The software is available for download at: http://github.com/phac-nml/neptune.",20.0,20.0,7.0,7.0,2.0,7.0,3.0,7.0,329.0,5.0,46.443,None

This year we introduced three newly annotated species and released numerous updates across our supported species with a concentration on data for the latest genome assemblies of human, mouse, zebrafish and rat. We also provided two data updates for the previous human assembly, GRCh37, through a dedicated website (http://grch37.ensembl.org). Our tools, in particular the VEP, have been improved significantly through integration of additional third party data. REST is now capable of larger-scale analysis and our regulatory data BioMart can deliver faster results. The website is now capable of displaying long-range interactions such as those found in cis-regulated datasets.

tcga-assembler_2,compgenome365,TCGA-Assembler-2,"Motivation The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program has produced huge amounts of cancer genomics data providing unprecedented opportunities for research. In 2014, we developed TCGA-Assembler, a software pipeline for retrieval and processing of public TCGA data. In 2016, TCGA data were transferred from the TCGA data portal to the Genomic Data Commons (GDCs), which is supported by a different set of data storage and retrieval mechanisms. In addition, new proteomics data of TCGA samples have been generated by the Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) program, which were not available for downloading through TCGA-Assembler. It is desirable to acquire and integrate data from both GDC and CPTAC. Results We develop TCGA-assembler 2 (TA2) to automatically download and integrate data from GDC and CPTAC. We make substantial improvement on the functionality of TA2 to enhance user experience and software performance. TA2 together with its previous version have helped more than 2000 researchers from 64 countries to access and utilize TCGA and CPTAC data in their research. Availability of TA2 will continue to allow existing and new users to conduct reproducible research based on TCGA and CPTAC data.

PatchSearch,,,"Many therapeutic molecules are known to bind several proteins, which can be different from the initially targeted one. Such unexpected interactions with proteins called off-targets can lead to adverse effects. Potential off-target identification is important to predict to avoid drug side effects or to discover new targets for existing drugs. We propose a new program named PatchSearch that implements local nonsequential searching for similar binding sites on protein surfaces with a controlled amount of flexibility. It is based on detection of quasi-cliques in product graphs representing all the possible matchings between two compared structures. This method has been benchmarked on a large diversity of ligands and on five data sets ranging from 12 to more than 7000 protein structures. The experiments conducted in this study show that the PatchSearch method could be useful in the early identification of off-targets. The program and the benchmarks presented in this paper are available as an R package at https://github.com/MTiPatchSearch.",,,,,,,,,,,,Mature

deepcell,vanvalenlab,kiosk-console,"Deep learning is transforming the analysis of biological images, but applying these models to large datasets remains challenging. Here we describe the DeepCell Kiosk, cloud-native software that dynamically scales deep learning workflows to accommodate large imaging datasets. To demonstrate the scalability and affordability of this software, we identified cell nuclei in 106 1-megapixel images in ~5.5 h for ~US$250, with a cost below US$100 achievable depending on cluster configuration.

ngs_backbone,JoseBlanca,franklin.,"Background: The possibilities offered by next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms are revolutionizing biotechnological laboratories. Moreover, the combination of NGS sequencing and affordable high-throughput genotyping technologies is facilitating the rapid discovery and use of SNPs in non-model species. However, this abundance of sequences and polymorphisms creates new software needs. To fulfill these needs, we have developed a powerful, yet easy-to-use application.Results: The ngs_backbone software is a parallel pipeline capable of analyzing Sanger, 454, Illumina and SOLiD (Sequencing by Oligonucleotide Ligation and Detection) sequence reads. Its main supported analyses are: read cleaning, transcriptome assembly and annotation, read mapping and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and selection. In order to build a truly useful tool, the software development was paired with a laboratory experiment. All public tomato Sanger EST reads plus 14.2 million Illumina reads were employed to test the tool and predict polymorphism in tomato. The cleaned reads were mapped to the SGN tomato transcriptome obtaining a coverage of 4.2 for Sanger and 8.5 for Illumina. 23,360 single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were predicted. A total of 76 SNVs were experimentally validated, and 85% were found to be real.Conclusions: ngs_backbone is a new software package capable of analyzing sequences produced by NGS technologies and predicting SNVs with great accuracy. In our tomato example, we created a highly polymorphic collection of SNVs that will be a useful resource for tomato researchers and breeders. The software developed along with its documentation is freely available under the AGPL license and can be downloaded from http://bioinf.comav.upv.es/ngs_backbone/ or http://github.com/JoseBlanca/franklin. © 2011 Blanca et al",,,,,,,,,,,,Mature

r2dgc,rramaker,R2DGC,"Summary Comprehensive 2D gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is a powerful method for analyzing complex mixtures of volatile compounds, but produces a large amount of raw data that requires downstream processing to align signals of interest (peaks) across multiple samples and match peak characteristics to reference standard libraries prior to downstream statistical analysis. Very few existing tools address this aspect of analysis and those that do have shortfalls in usability or performance. We have developed an R package that implements retention time and mass spectra similarity threshold-free alignments, seamlessly integrates retention time standards for universally reproducible alignments, performs common ion filtering and provides compatibility with multiple peak quantification methods. We demonstrate that our package's performance compares favorably to existing tools on a controlled mix of metabolite standards separated under variable chromatography conditions and data generated from cell lines. Availability and implementation R2DGC can be downloaded at https://github.com/rramaker/R2DGC or installed via the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).",3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,7.0,0.0,,None

glycresoft,BostonUniversityCBMS,glycresoft.,"Motivation Glycosylation is one of the most heterogeneous and complex protein post-translational modifications. Liquid chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a common high throughput method for analyzing complex biological samples. Accurate study of glycans require high resolution mass spectrometry. Mass spectrometry data contains intricate sub-structures that encode mass and abundance, requiring several transformations before it can be used to identify biological molecules, requiring automated tools to analyze samples in a high throughput setting. Existing tools for interpreting the resulting data do not take into account related glycans when evaluating individual observations, limiting their sensitivity. Results We developed an algorithm for assigning glycan compositions from LC-MS data by exploring biosynthetic network relationships among glycans. Our algorithm optimizes a set of likelihood scoring functions based on glycan chemical properties but uses network Laplacian regularization and optionally prior information about expected glycan families to smooth the likelihood and thus achieve a consistent and more representative solution. Our method was able to identify as many, or more glycan compositions compared to previous approaches, and demonstrated greater sensitivity with regularization. Our network definition was tailored to N-glycans but the method may be applied to glycomics data from other glycan families like O-glycans or heparan sulfate where the relationships between compositions can be expressed as a graph.

micnet,Labevo,MicNet,"on the other hand, we have included a module that runs an enhanced version of the SparCC code, sustaining larger datasets than before, and we couple the resulting networks with network theory analyses to describe the resulting co-occurrence networks, including several novel analyses, such as structural balance metrics and a proposal to discover the underlying topology of a co-occurrence network. We validated the proposed toolbox on 1) a simple and well described biological network of kombucha, consisting of 48 ASVs, and 2) we validate the improvements of our new version of SparCC. Finally, we showcase the use of the MicNet toolbox on a large dataset from Archean Domes, consisting of more than 2,000 ASVs. Our toolbox is freely available as a github repository (https://github.com/Labevo/MicNet Toolbox), and it is accompanied by a web dashboard (http://micnetapplb-1212130533.useast-1.elb.amazonaws.com) that can be used in a simple and straightforward manner with relative abundance data. This easy-to-use implementation is aimed to microbial ecologists with little to no experience in programming, while the most experienced bioinformatics will also be able to manipulate the source code’s functions with ease.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

asthmakgxe,ChaiAsaad,MoreAIRAsthmaKGxE,"Motivation: Asthma is a complex heterogeneous disease resulting from intricate interactions between genetic and non-genetic factors related to environmental and psychosocial aspects. Discovery of such interactions can provide insights into the pathophysiology and etiology of asthma. In this paper, we propose an asthma knowledge graph (KG) built using a hybrid methodology for graph-based modeling of asthma complexity with a focus on environmental interactions. Using a heterogeneous set of public sources, we construct a genetic and pharmacogenetic asthma knowledge graph. The construction of this KG allowed us to shed more light on the lack of curated resources focused on environmental influences related to asthma. To remedy the lack of environmental data in our KG, we exploit the biomedical literature using state-of-the-art natural language processing and construct the first Asthma–Environment interaction catalog incorporating a continuously updated ensemble of environmental, psychological, nutritional and socio-economic influences. The catalog's most substantiated results are then integrated into the KG. Results: The resulting environmentally rich knowledge graph ”AsthmaKGxE” aims to provide a resource for several potential applications of artificial intelligence and allows for a multi-perspective study of asthma. Our insight extraction results indicate that stress is the most frequent asthma association in the corpus, followed by allergens and obesity. We contend that studying asthma–environment interactions in more depth holds the key to curbing the complexity and heterogeneity of asthma. Availability: A user interface to browse and download the extracted catalog as well as the KG are available at http://asthmakgxe.moreair.info/. The code and supplementary data are available on github (https://github.com/ChaiAsaad/MoreAIRAsthmaKGxE).",1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,9.0,0.0,,None

ledpred,aitgon,LedPred,"Summary: Supervised classification based on support vector machines (SVMs) has successfully been used for the prediction of cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). However, no integrated tool using such heterogeneous data as position-specific scoring matrices, ChIP-seq data or conservation scores is currently available. Here, we present LedPred, a flexible SVM workflow that predicts new regulatory sequences based on the annotation of known CRMs, which are associated to a large variety of feature types. LedPred is provided as an R/Bioconductor package connected to an online server to avoid installation of non-R software. Due to the heterogeneous CRM feature integration, LedPred excels at the prediction of regulatory sequences in Drosophila and mouse datasets compared with similar SVM-based software.

ACSN,caanene1,ACSNI,"Determining the tissue- and disease-specific circuit of biological pathways remains a fundamental goal of molecular biology. Many components of these biological pathways still remain unknown, hindering the full and accurate characterization of biological processes of interest. Here we describe ACSNI, an algorithm that combines prior knowledge of biological processes with a deep neural network to effectively decompose gene expression profiles (GEPs) into multi-variable pathway activities and identify unknown pathway components. Experiments on public GEP data show that ACSNI predicts cogent components of mTOR, ATF2, and HOTAIRM1 signaling that recapitulate regulatory information from genetic perturbation and transcription factor binding datasets. Our framework provides a fast and easy-to-use method to identify components of signaling pathways as a tool for molecular mechanism discovery and to prioritize genes for designing future targeted experiments (https://github.com/caanene1/ACSNI).",4.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,0.0,4.0,2.0,4.0,36.0,0.0,,None

ipk-cats,tschmutzer,kmasker.,"Many plant genomes display high levels of repetitive sequences. The assembly of these complex genomes using short high-throughput sequence reads is still a challenging task. Underestimation or disregard of repeat complexity in these datasets can easily misguide downstream analysis. Detection of repetitive regions by k-mer counting methods has proved to be reliable. Easy-to-use applications utilizing k-mer counting are in high demand, especially in the domain of plants. We present Kmasker plants, a tool that uses k-mer count information as an assistant throughout the analytical workflow of genome data that is provided as a command-line and web-based solution. Beside its core competence to screen and mask repetitive sequences, we have integrated features that enable comparative studies between different cultivars or closely related species and methods that estimate target specificity of guide RNAs for application of site-directed mutagenesis using Cas9 endonuclease. In addition, we have set up a web service for Kmasker plants that maintains pre-computed indices for 10 of the economically most important cultivated plants. Source code for Kmasker plants has been made publically available at https://github.com/tschmutzer/kmasker. The web service is accessible at https://kmasker.ipk-gatersleben.de.",,,,,,,,,,,,Mature

kuala,molinfrimed,multi-kinases,"The family of protein kinases comprises more than 500 genes involved in numerous functions. Hence, their physiological dysfunction has paved the way toward drug discovery for cancer, cardiovascular, and inflammatory diseases. As a matter of fact, Kinase binding sites high similarity has a double role. On the one hand it is a critical issue for selectivity, on the other hand, according to poly-pharmacology, a synergistic controlled effect on more than one target could be of great pharmacological interest. Another important aspect of binding similarity is the possibility of exploit it for repositioning of drugs on targets of the same family. In this study, we propose our approach called Kinase drUgs mAchine Learning frAmework (KUALA) to automatically identify kinase active ligands by using specific sets of molecular descriptors and provide a multi-target priority score and a repurposing threshold to suggest the best repurposable and non-repurposable molecules. The comprehensive list of all kinase-ligand pairs and their scores can be found at https://github.com/molinfrimed/multi-kinases.",3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,21.0,0.0,,None

hsdfinder,zx0223winner,HSDFinder,"Gene duplication is an important evolutionary mechanism capable of providing new genetic material for adaptive and nonadaptive evolution. However, bioinformatics tools for identifying duplicate genes are often limited to the detection of paralogs in multiple species or to specific types of gene duplicates, such as retrocopies. Here, we present a user-friendly, BLAST-based web tool, called HSDFinder, which can identify, annotate, categorize, and visualize highly similar duplicate genes (HSDs) in eukaryotic nuclear genomes. HSDFinder includes an online heatmap plotting option, allowing users to compare HSDs among different species and visualize the results in different Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway functional categories. The external software requirements are BLAST, InterProScan, and KEGG. The utility of HSDFinder was tested on various model eukaryotic species, including Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa, and Zea mays as well as the psychrophilic green alga Chlamydomonas sp. UWO241, and was proven to be a practical and accurate tool for gene duplication analyses. The web tool is free to use at http://hsdfinder.com.

graphbio,databio2022,GraphBio,"Background: Massive amounts of omics data are produced and usually require sophisticated visualization analysis. These analyses often require programming skills, which are difficult for experimental biologists. Thus, more user-friendly tools are urgently needed. Methods and Results: Herein, we present GraphBio, a shiny web app to easily perform visualization analysis for omics data. GraphBio provides 15 popular visualization analysis methods, including heatmap, volcano plots, MA plots, network plots, dot plots, chord plots, pie plots, four quadrant diagrams, Venn diagrams, cumulative distribution curves, principal component analysis (PCA), survival analysis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, correlation analysis, and text cluster analysis. It enables experimental biologists without programming skills to easily perform popular visualization analysis and get publication-ready figures. Conclusion: GraphBio, as an online web application, is freely available at http://www.graphbio1.com/en/ (English version) and http://www.graphbio1.com/ (Chinese version). The source code of GraphBio is available at https://github.com/databio2022/GraphBio.",33.0,33.0,3.0,14.0,1.0,14.0,2.0,0.0,14.0,1.0,7.445,None

sema_web,AIRI-Institute,SEMAi,"One of the primary tasks in vaccine design and development of immunotherapeutic drugs is to predict conformational B-cell epitopes corresponding to primary antibody binding sites within the antigen tertiary structure. To date, multiple approaches have been developed to address this issue. However, for a wide range of antigens their accuracy is limited. In this paper, we applied the transfer learning approach using pretrained deep learning models to develop a model that predicts conformational B-cell epitopes based on the primary antigen sequence and tertiary structure. A pretrained protein language model, ESM-1v, and an inverse folding model, ESM-IF1, were fine-tuned to quantitatively predict antibody-antigen interaction features and distinguish between epitope and non-epitope residues. The resulting model called SEMA demonstrated the best performance on an independent test set with ROC AUC of 0.76 compared to peer-reviewed tools. We show that SEMA can quantitatively rank the immunodominant regions within the SARS-CoV-2 RBD domain. SEMA is available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SEMAi and the web-interface http://sema.airi.net.",44.0,44.0,1.0,13.0,2.0,13.0,7.0,2.0,51.0,3.0,133.794,None

lambdapp,,,"variant effect) in seconds. The structure prediction provided by LambdaPP—leveraging ColabFold and computed in minutes—is based on MMseqs2 multiple sequence alignments. All other feature prediction methods are based on the pLM ProtT5. Queried by a protein sequence, LambdaPP computes protein and residue predictions almost instantly for various phenotypes, including 3D structure and aspects of protein function. LambdaPP is freely available for everyone to use under embed.predictprotein.org, the interactive results for the case study can be found under https://embed.predictprotein.org/o/Q9NZC2. The frontend of LambdaPP can be found on GitHub (github.com/sacdallago/embed.predictprotein.org), and can be freely used and distributed under the academic free use license (AFL-2). For high-throughput applications, all methods can be executed locally via the bio-embeddings (bioembeddings.com) python package, or docker image at ghcr.io/bioembeddings/bio_embeddings, which also includes the backend of LambdaPP.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

seqkit,shenwei356,seqkit,"FASTA and FASTQ are basic and ubiquitous formats for storing nucleotide and protein sequences. Common manipulations of FASTA/Q file include converting, searching, filtering, deduplication, splitting, shuffling, and sampling. Existing tools only implement some of these manipulations, and not particularly efficiently, and some are only available for certain operating systems. Furthermore, the complicated installation process of required packages and running environments can render these programs less user friendly. This paper describes a cross-platform ultrafast comprehensive toolkit for FASTA/Q processing. SeqKit provides executable binary files for all major operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and Mac OSX, and can be directly used without any dependencies or pre-configurations. SeqKit demonstrates competitive performance in execution time and memory usage compared to similar tools. The efficiency and usability of SeqKit enable researchers to rapidly accomplish common FASTA/Q file manipulations. SeqKit is open source and available on Github at https://github.com/shenwei356/seqkit.",1481.0,1481.0,24.0,173.0,25.0,173.0,20.0,91.0,856.0,65.0,64.336,None

r2dt_ebi,rnacentral,R2DT,"Non-coding RNAs (ncRNA) are essential for all life, and their functions often depend on their secondary (2D) and tertiary structure. Despite the abundance of software for the visualisation of ncRNAs, few automatically generate consistent and recognisable 2D layouts, which makes it challenging for users to construct, compare and analyse structures. Here, we present R2DT, a method for predicting and visualising a wide range of RNA structures in standardised layouts. R2DT is based on a library of 3,647 templates representing the majority of known structured RNAs. R2DT has been applied to ncRNA sequences from the RNAcentral database and produced >13 million diagrams, creating the world’s largest RNA 2D structure dataset. The software is amenable to community expansion, and is freely available at https://github.com/rnacentral/R2DT and a web server is found at https://rnacentral.org/r2dt.",76.0,76.0,6.0,12.0,53.0,12.0,11.0,8.0,1040.0,84.0,357.338,None
deepcmi,LiYuechao1998,DeepCMI,"Recently, the role of competing endogenous RNAs in regulating gene expression through the interaction of microRNAs has been closely associated with the expression of circular RNAs (circRNAs) in various biological processes such as reproduction and apoptosis. While the number of confirmed circRNA–miRNA interactions (CMIs) continues to increase, the conventional in vitro approaches for discovery are expensive, labor intensive, and time consuming. Therefore, there is an urgent need for effective prediction of potential CMIs through appropriate data modeling and prediction based on known information. In this study, we proposed a novel model, called DeepCMI, that utilizes multi-source information on circRNA/miRNA to predict potential CMIs. Comprehensive evaluations on the CMI-9905 and CMI-9589 datasets demonstrated that DeepCMI successfully infers potential CMIs. Specifically, DeepCMI achieved AUC values of 90.54% and 94.8% on the CMI-9905 and CMI-9589 datasets, respectively. These results suggest that DeepCMI is an effective model for predicting potential CMIs and has the potential to significantly reduce the need for downstream in vitro studies. To facilitate the use of our trained model and data, we have constructed a computational platform, which is available at http://120.77.11.78/DeepCMI/. The source code and datasets used in this work are available at https://github.com/LiYuechao1998/DeepCMI.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

cord,ToHanwei,"Genome2OR.git),","Olfactory receptors are poorly annotated for most genome-sequenced chordates. To address this deficiency, we developed a nhmmer-based olfactory receptor annotation tool Genome2OR (https://github.com/ToHanwei/Genome2OR.git), and used it to process 1,695 sequenced chordate genomes in the NCBI Assembly database as of January, 2021. In total, 765,248 olfactory receptor genes were annotated, with 404,426 functional genes and 360,822 pseudogenes, which represents a four-fold increase in the number of annotated olfactory receptors. Based on the annotation data, we built a database called Chordata Olfactory Receptor Database (CORD, https://cord.ihuman.shanghaitech.edu.cn) for archiving, analysing and disseminating the data. Beyond the primary data, we offer derivative information, including pictures of species, cross references to public databases, structural models, sequence similarity networks and sequence profiles in the CORD. Furthermore, we did brief analyses on these receptors, including building a huge protein sequence similarity network covering all receptors in the database, and clustering them into 20 communities, classifying the 20 communities into three categories based on their presences/absences in ray-finned fish and/or lobe-finned fish. We infer that olfactory receptors should have unique activation and desensitization mechanisms by analysing their sequences and structural models. We believe the CORD can benefit the researchers and the general public who are interested in olfaction.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

biomobs,,,"One of the challenges in multi-omics data analysis for precision medicine is the efficient exploration of undiscovered molecular interactions in disease processes. We present Bio- MOBS, a workflow consisting of two data visualization tools integrated with an open-source molecular information database to perform clinically relevant analyses (https://github.com/ driesheylen123/BioMOBS). We performed exploratory pathway analysis with BioMOBS and demonstrate its ability to generate relevant molecular hypotheses, by reproducing recent findings in type 2 diabetes UK biobank data. The central visualisation tool, where data-driven and literature-based findings can be integrated, is available within the github link as well. BioMOBS is a workflow that leverages information from multiple data-driven interactive analyses and visually integrates it with established pathway knowledge. The demonstrated use cases place trust in the usage of BioMOBS as a procedure to offer clinically relevant insights in disease pathway analyses on various types of omics data.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

ccml,pulmonomics-lab,"ccml,","Multi-omics data integration is a complex and challenging task in biomedical research. Consensus clustering, also known as meta-clustering or cluster ensembles, has become an increasingly popular downstream tool for phenotyping and endotyping using multiple omics and clinical data. However, current consensus clustering methods typically rely on ensembling clustering outputs with similar sample coverages (mathematical replicates), which may not reflect real-world data with varying sample coverages (biological replicates). To address this issue, we propose a new consensus clustering with missing labels (ccml) strategy termed ccml, an R protocol for two-step consensus clustering that can handle unequal missing labels (i.e. multiple predictive labels with different sample coverages). Initially, the regular consensus weights are adjusted (normalized) by sample coverage, then a regular consensus clustering is performed to predict the optimal final cluster. We applied the ccml method to predict molecularly distinct groups based on 9-omics integration in the Karolinska COSMIC cohort, which investigates chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 24-omics handprint integrative subgrouping of adult asthma patients of the U-BIOPRED cohort.

timed-design,wells-wood-research,ti,"Sequence design is a crucial step in the process of designing or engineering proteins. Traditionally, physics-based methods have been used to solve for optimal sequences, with the main disadvantages being that they are computationally intensive for the end user. Deep learning-based methods offer an attractive alternative, outperforming physics-based methods at a significantly lower computational cost. In this paper, we explore the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for sequence design. We describe the development and benchmarking of a range of networks, as well as reimplementations of previously described CNNs. We demonstrate the flexibility of representing proteins in a three-dimensional voxel grid by encoding additional design constraints into the input data. Finally, we describe TIMED-Design, a web application and command line tool for exploring and applying the models described in this paper.

serotoninai,nczub,SerotoninAI_streamlit,"SerotoninAI is an innovative web application for scientific purposes focused on the serotonergic system. By leveraging SerotoninAI, researchers can assess the affinity (pKi value) of a molecule to all main serotonin receptors and serotonin transporters based on molecule structure introduced as SMILES. Additionally, the application provides essential insights into critical attributes of potential drugs such as blood-brain barrier penetration and human intestinal absorption. The complexity of the serotonergic system demands advanced tools for accurate predictions, which is a fundamental requirement in drug development. SerotoninAI addresses this need by providing an intuitive user interface that generates predictions of pKi values for the main serotonergic targets. The application is freely available on the Internet at https://serotoninai.streamlit.app/, implemented in Streamlit with all major web browsers supported. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, there is no tool that allows users to access affinity predictions for serotonergic targets without registration or financial obligations. SerotoninAI significantly increases the scope of drug development activities worldwide.

hivseqdb,AlfredUg,HIVseqDB.,"Summary: Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) remains a public health threat, with drug resistance being a major concern in HIV treatment. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool for identifying low-abundance drug resistance mutations (LA-DRMs) that conventional Sanger sequencing cannot reliably detect. To fully understand the significance of LA-DRMs, it is necessary to integrate NGS data with clinical and demographic data. However, freely available tools for NGS-based HIV-1 drug resistance analysis do not integrate these data. This poses a challenge in interpretation of the impact of LA-DRMs, mainly for resource-limited settings due to the shortage of bioinformatics expertise. To address this challenge, we present HIVseqDB, a portable, secure, and user-friendly resource for integrating NGS data with associated clinical and demographic data for analysis of HIV drug resistance. HIVseqDB currently supports uploading of NGS data and associated sample data, HIV-1 drug resistance data analysis, browsing of uploaded data, and browsing and visualizing of analysis results. Each function of HIVseqDB corresponds to an individual Django application. This ensures efficient incorporation of additional features with minimal effort. HIVseqDB can be deployed on various computing environments, such as on-premises high-performance computing facilities and cloud-based platforms.

rt_transformer,01dadada,RT-Transformer.,"Motivation: Liquid chromatography retention times prediction can assist in metabolite identification, which is a critical task and challenge in nontargeted metabolomics. However, different chromatographic conditions may result in different retention times for the same metabolite. Current retention time prediction methods lack sufficient scalability to transfer from one specific chromatographic method to another. Results: Therefore, we present RT-Transformer, a novel deep neural network model coupled with graph attention network and 1D-Transformer, which can predict retention times under any chromatographic methods. First, we obtain a pre-trained model by training RT-Transformer on the large small molecule retention time dataset containing 80 038 molecules, and then transfer the resulting model to different chromatographic methods based on transfer learning. When tested on the small molecule retention time dataset, as other authors did, the average absolute error reached 27.30 after removing not retained molecules. Still, it reached 33.41 when no samples were removed. The pretrained RT-Transformer was further transferred to 5 datasets corresponding to different chromatographic conditions and fine-tuned. According to the experimental results, RT-Transformer achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, RT-Transformer was applied to 41 external molecular retention time datasets. Extensive evaluations indicate that RT-Transformer has excellent scalability in predicting retention times for liquid chromatography and improves the accuracy of metabolite identification. Availability and implementation: The source code for the model is available at https://github.com/01dadada/RT-Transformer.

cosap,MBaysanLab,cosap,"Background: Recent improvements in sequencing technologies enabled detailed profiling of genomic features. These technologies mostly rely on short reads which are merged and compared to reference genome for variant identification. These operations should be done with computers due to the size and complexity of the data. The need for analysis software resulted in many programs for mapping, variant calling and annotation steps. Currently, most programs are either expensive enterprise software with proprietary code which makes access and verification very difficult or open-access programs that are mostly based on command-line operations without user interfaces and extensive documentation. Moreover, a high level of disagreement is observed among popular mapping and variant calling algorithms in multiple studies, which makes relying on a single algorithm unreliable. User-friendly open-source software tools that offer comparative analysis are an important need considering the growth of sequencing technologies. Results: Here, we propose Comparative Sequencing Analysis Platform (COSAP), an open-source platform that provides popular sequencing algorithms for SNV, indel, structural variant calling, copy number variation, microsatellite instability and fusion analysis and their annotations. COSAP is packed with a fully functional user-friendly web interface and a backend server which allows full independent deployment for both individual and institutional scales. COSAP is developed as a workflow management system and designed to enhance cooperation among scientists with different backgrounds. It is publicly available at https://cosap.bio and https://github.com/MBaysanLab/cosap/. The source code of the frontend and backend services can be found at https://github.com/MBaysanLab/cosap-webapi/ and https://github.com/MBaysanLab/cosap_frontend/ respectively. All services are packed as Docker containers as well. Pipelines that combine algorithms can be customized and new algorithms can be added with minimal coding through modular structure. Conclusions: COSAP simplifies and speeds up the process of DNA sequencing analyses providing commonly used algorithms for SNV, indel, structural variant calling, copy number variation, microsatellite instability and fusion analysis as well as their annotations. COSAP is packed with a fully functional user-friendly web interface and a backend server which allows full independent deployment for both individual and institutional scales. Standardized implementations of popular algorithms in a modular platform make comparisons much easier to assess the impact of alternative pipelines which is crucial in establishing reproducibility of sequencing analyses.",17.0,17.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,7.0,2.0,365.0,21.0,,None

metdit,Li-OmicsLab,"MetDIT,","Clinical metabolomics is growing as an essential tool for precision medicine. However, classical machine learning algorithms struggle to comprehensively encode and analyze the metabolomics data due to their high dimensionality and complex intercorrelations. This article introduces a new method called MetDIT, designed to analyze intricate metabolomics data effectively using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). MetDIT comprises two components: TransOmics and NetOmics. Since CNN models have difficulty in processing one-dimensional (1D) sequence data efficiently, we developed TransOmics, a framework that transforms sequence data into two-dimensional (2D) images while maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between the sequences and images. NetOmics, the second component, leverages a CNN architecture to extract more discriminative representations from the transformed samples. To overcome the overfitting due to the small sample size and class imbalance, we introduced a feature augmentation module (FAM) and a loss function to improve the model performance. Furthermore, we systematically optimized the model backbone and image resolution to balance the model parameters and computational costs. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed MetDIT, we conducted extensive experiments using three different clinical metabolomics data sets and achieved better classification performance than classical machine learning methods used in metabolomics, including Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The source code is available at the GitHub repository at https://github.com/Li-OmicsLab/MetDIT, and the WebApp can be found at http://metdit.bioinformatics.vip/.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

fretpredict,,,"Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) is a widely-used and versatile technique for the structural characterization of biomolecules. Here, we introduce FRETpredict, an easy-to-use Python software to predict FRET efficiencies from ensembles of protein conformations. FRETpredict uses a rotamer library approach to describe the FRET probes covalently bound to the protein. The software efficiently and flexibly operates on large conformational ensembles such as those generated by molecular dynamics simulations to facilitate the validation or refinement of molecular models and the interpretation of experimental data. We provide access to rotamer libraries for many commonly used dyes and linkers and describe a general methodology to generate new rotamer libraries for FRET probes. We demonstrate the performance and accuracy of the software for different types of systems: a rigid peptide (polyproline 11), an intrinsically disordered protein (ACTR), and three folded proteins (HiSiaP, SBD2, and MalE). FRETpredict is open source (GPLv3) and is available at github.com/KULL-Centre/FRETpredict and as a Python PyPI package at pypi.org/project/FRETpredict.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

tcmnpas,yangpluszhu,"tcmnpas),","The application of network formulaology and network pharmacology has significantly advanced the scientific understanding of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment mechanisms in disease. The field of herbal biology is experiencing a surge in data generation. However, researchers are encountering challenges due to the fragmented nature of the data and the reliance on programming tools for data analysis. We have developed TCMNPAS, a comprehensive analysis platform that integrates network formularology and network pharmacology. This platform is designed to investigate in-depth the compatibility characteristics of TCM formulas and their potential molecular mechanisms. TCMNPAS incorporates multiple resources and offers a range of functions designed for automated analysis implementation, including prescription mining, molecular docking, network pharmacology analysis, and visualization. These functions enable researchers to analyze and obtain core herbs and core formulas from herbal prescription data through prescription mining. Additionally, TCMNPAS facilitates virtual screening of active compounds in TCM and its formulas through batch molecular docking, allowing for the rapid construction and analysis of networks associated with “herb-compound-target-pathway” and disease targets. Built upon the integrated analysis concept of network formulaology and network pharmacology, TCMNPAS enables quick point-and-click completion of network-based association analysis, spanning from core formula mining from clinical data to the exploration of therapeutic targets for disease treatment. TCMNPAS serves as a powerful platform for uncovering the combinatorial rules and mechanism of TCM formulas holistically. We distribute TCMNPAS within an open-source R package at GitHub (https://github.com/yangpluszhu/tcmnpas), and the project is freely available at http://54.223.75.62:3838/.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

toxinpred3,raghavagps,toxinpred3,"however, the method suffered from inadequate coverage. Subsequently, we employed a motif-based approach using MERCI software to uncover specific patterns or motifs that are exclusively observed in toxic peptides. The search for these motifs in peptides allowed us to predict toxic peptides with a high level of specificity with poor sensitivity. To overcome the coverage limitations, we developed alignment-free methods using machine/deep learning techniques to balance sensitivity and specificity of prediction. Deep learning model (ANN - LSTM with fixed sequence length) developed using one-hot encoding achieved a maximum AUROC of 0.93 with MCC of 0.71 on an independent dataset. Machine learning model (extra tree) developed using compositional features of peptides achieved a maximum AUROC of 0.95 with MCC of 0.78. We also developed large language models and achieved maximum AUC of 0.93 using ESM2-t33. Finally, we developed hybrid or ensemble methods combining two or more methods to enhance performance. Our specific hybrid method, which combines a motif-based approach with a machine learning-based model, achieved a maximum AUROC of 0.98 with MCC 0.81 on an independent dataset. In this study, all models were trained and tested on 80 % of data using five-fold cross-validation and evaluated on the remaining 20 % of data called independent dataset. The evaluation of all methods on an independent dataset revealed that the method proposed in this study exhibited better performance than existing methods. To cater to the needs of the scientific community, we have developed a standalone software, pip package and web-based server ToxinPred3 (https://github.com/raghavagps/toxinpred3 and https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/toxinpred3/).",18.0,18.0,1.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,0.0,31.0,0.0,0.1,None

cytoviewer,BodenmillerGroup,cytoviewer,"Background: Highly multiplexed imaging enables single-cell-resolved detection of numerous biological molecules in their spatial tissue context. Interactive visualization of multiplexed imaging data is crucial at any step of data analysis to facilitate quality control and the spatial exploration of single cell features. However, tools for interactive visualization of multiplexed imaging data are not available in the statistical programming language R. Results: Here, we describe cytoviewer, an R/Bioconductor package for interactive visualization and exploration of multi-channel images and segmentation masks. The cytoviewer package supports flexible generation of image composites, allows side-by-side visualization of single channels, and facilitates the spatial visualization of single-cell data in the form of segmentation masks. As such, cytoviewer improves image and segmentation quality control, the visualization of cell phenotyping results and qualitative validation of hypothesis at any step of data analysis. The package operates on standard data classes of the Bioconductor project and therefore integrates with an extensive framework for single-cell and image analysis. The graphical user interface allows intuitive navigation and little coding experience is required to use the package. We showcase the functionality and biological application of cytoviewer by analysis of an imaging mass cytometry dataset acquired from cancer samples. Conclusions: The cytoviewer package offers a rich set of features for highly multiplexed imaging data visualization in R that seamlessly integrates with the workflow for image and single-cell data analysis. It can be installed from Bioconductor via https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/cytoviewer.html .

bd_rpc,Bin-Ma,bd-rpc,"Understanding phylogenetic relationships among species is essential for many biological studies, which call for an accurate phylogenetic tree to understand major evolutionary transitions. The phylogenetic analyses present a major challenge in estimation accuracy and computational efficiency, especially recently facing a wave of severe emerging infectious disease outbreaks. Here, we introduced a novel, efficient framework called Bases-dependent Rapid Phylogenetic Clustering (Bd-RPC) for new sample placement for viruses. In this study, a brand-new recoding method called Frequency Vector Recoding was implemented to approximate the phylogenetic distance, and the Phylogenetic Simulated Annealing Search algorithm was developed to match the recoded distance matrix with the phylogenetic tree. Meanwhile, the indel (insertion/deletion) was heuristically introduced to foreign sequence recognition for the first time. Here, we compared the Bd-RPC with the recent placement software (PAGAN2, EPA-ng, TreeBeST) and evaluated it in Alphacoronavirus, Alphaherpesvirinae, and Betacoronavirus by using Split and Robinson-Foulds distances. The comparisons showed that Bd-RPC maintained the highest precision with great efficiency, demonstrating good performance in new sample placement on all three virus genera. Finally, a user-friendly website (http://www.bd-rpc.xyz) is available for users to classify new samples instantly and facilitate exploration of the phylogenetic research in viruses, and the Bd-RPC is available on GitHub (http://github.com/Bin-Ma/bd-rpc).",3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,1.0,40.0,0.0,,None

neo4jsbml,brsynth,neo4jsbml,"Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) has emerged as a standard for representing biological models, facilitating model sharing and interoperability. It stores many types of data and complex relationships, complicating data management and analysis. Traditional database management systems struggle to effectively capture these complex networks of interactions within biological systems. Graph-oriented databases perform well in managing interactions between different entities. We present neo4jsbml, a new solution that bridges the gap between the Systems Biology Markup Language data and the Neo4j database, for storing, querying and analyzing data. The Systems Biology Markup Language organizes biological entities in a hierarchical structure, reflecting their interdependencies. The inherent graphical structure represents these hierarchical relationships, offering a natural and efficient means of navigating and exploring the model’s components. Neo4j is an excellent solution for handling this type of data. By representing entities as nodes and their relationships as edges, Cypher, Neo4j’s query language, efficiently traverses this type of graph representing complex biological networks. We have developed neo4jsbml, a Python library for importing Systems Biology Markup Language data into a Neo4j database using a user-defined schema. By leveraging Neo4j’s graphical database technology, exploration of complex biological networks becomes intuitive and information retrieval efficient. Neo4jsbml is a tool designed to import Systems Biology Markup Language data into a Neo4j database. Only the desired data is loaded into the Neo4j database. neo4jsbml is user-friendly and can become a useful new companion for visualizing and analyzing metabolic models through the Neo4j graphical database. neo4jsbml is open source software and available at https://github.com/brsynth/neo4jsbml.",4.0,4.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,,,12.0,166.0,29.0,138.201,None

rediportal,BioinfoUNIBA,REDItools,"RNA editing is a widespread post-transcriptional mechanism able to modify transcripts through insertions/deletions or base substitutions. It is prominent in mammals, in which millions of adenosines are deaminated to inosines by members of the ADAR family of enzymes. A-to-I RNA editing has a plethora of biological functions, but its detection in large-scale transcriptome datasets is still an unsolved computational task. To this aim, we developed REDItools, the first software package devoted to the RNA editing profiling in RNA-sequencing (RNAseq) data. It has been successfully used in human transcriptomes, proving the tissue and cell type specificity of RNA editing as well as its pervasive nature. Outcomes from large-scale REDItools analyses on human RNAseq data have been collected in our specialized REDIportal database, containing more than 4.5 million events. Here we describe in detail two bioinformatic procedures based on our computational resources, REDItools and REDIportal. In the first procedure, we outline a workflow to detect RNA editing in the human cell line NA12878, for which transcriptome and whole genome data are available. In the second procedure, we show how to identify dysregulated editing at specific recoding sites in post-mortem brain samples of Huntington disease donors. On a 64-bit computer running Linux with ≥32 GB of random-access memory (RAM), both procedures should take ~76 h, using 4 to 24 cores. Our protocols have been designed to investigate RNA editing in different organisms with available transcriptomic and/or genomic reads. Scripts to complete both procedures and a docker image are available at https://github.com/BioinfoUNIBA/REDItools.",68.0,68.0,3.0,34.0,17.0,,,1.0,250.0,5.0,229.689,Mature

il13pred,raghavagps,il13pred,"the best model was evaluated on an independent dataset. Results: Our best model based on XGBoost achieves a maximum AUC of 0.83 and 0.80 on the training and independent dataset, respectively. Our analysis indicates that certain SARS-COV2 variants are more prone to induce IL-13 in COVID-19 patients. Conclusion: The best performing model was incorporated in web-server and standalone package named ‘IL-13Pred’ for precise prediction of IL-13 inducing peptides. For large dataset analysis standalone package of IL-13Pred is available at (https://webs.iiitd.edu.in/raghava/il13pred/) webserver and over GitHub link: https://github.com/raghavagps/il13pred.",2.0,2.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,18.0,0.0,,None

getsequenceinfo,karubiotools,getSequenceInfo.,"© 2022, The Author(s).Background: Biological sequences are increasing rapidly and exponentially worldwide. Nucleotide sequence databases play an important role in providing meaningful genomic information on a variety of biological organisms. Results: The getSequenceInfo software tool allows to access sequence information from various public repositories (GenBank, RefSeq, and the European Nucleotide Archive), and is compatible with different operating systems (Linux, MacOS, and Microsoft Windows) in a programmatic way (command line) or as a graphical user interface. getSequenceInfo or gSeqI v1.0 should help users to get some information on queried sequences that could be useful for specific studies (e.g. the country of origin/isolation or the release date of queried sequences). Queries can be made to retrieve sequence data based on a given kingdom and species, or from a given date. This program allows the separation between chromosomes and plasmids (or other genetic elements/components) by arranging each component in a given folder. Some basic statistics are also performed by the program (such as the calculation of GC content for queried assemblies). An empirically designed nucleotide ratio is calculated using nucleotide information in order to tentatively provide a “NucleScore” for studied genome assemblies. Besides the main gSeqI tool, other additional tools have been developed to perform various tasks related to sequence analysis. Conclusion: The aim of this study is to democratize the use of public repositories in programmatic ways, and to facilitate sequence data analysis in a pedagogical perspective. Output results are available in FASTA, FASTQ, Excel/TSV or HTML formats. The program is freely available at: https://github.com/karubiotools/getSequenceInfo. getSequenceInfo and supplementary tools are partly available through the recently released Galaxy KaruBioNet platform (http://calamar.univ-ag.fr/c3i/galaxy_karubionet.html).",,,,,,,,,,,,None

ori-deep,WaqarHusain,OriDeep,"© 2022 The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please email: journals.permissions@oup.com.Replication of DNA is an important process for the cell division cycle, gene expression regulation and other biological evolution processes. It also has a crucial role in a living organism's physical growth and structure. Replication of DNA comprises of three stages known as initiation, elongation and termination, whereas the origin of replication sites (ORI) is the location of initiation of the DNA replication process. There exist various methodologies to identify ORIs in the genomic sequences, however, these methods have used either extensive computations for execution, or have limited optimization for the large datasets. Herein, a model called ORI-Deep is proposed to identify ORIs from the multiple cell type genomic sequence benchmark data. An efficient method is proposed using a deep neural network to identify ORIs for four different eukaryotic species. For better representation of data, a feature vector is constructed using statistical moments for the training and testing of data and is further fed to a long short-term memory (LSTM) network. To prove the effectiveness of the proposed model, we applied several validation techniques at different levels to obtain seven accuracy metrics, and the accuracy score for self-consistency, 10-fold cross-validation, jackknife and the independent set test is observed to be 0.977, 0.948, 0.976 and 0.977, respectively. Based on the results, it can be concluded that ORI-Deep can efficiently predict the sites of origin replication in DNA sequence with high accuracy. Webserver for ORI-Deep is available at (https://share.streamlit.io/waqarhusain/orideep/main/app.py), whereas source code is available at (https://github.com/WaqarHusain/OriDeep).",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,11.0,0.0,,None

predapp,xialab-ahu,PredAPP.,"© 2021, International Association of Scientists in the Interdisciplinary Areas.Anti-parasitic peptides (APPs) have been regarded as promising therapeutic candidate drugs against parasitic diseases. Due to the fact that the experimental techniques for identifying APPs are expensive and time-consuming, there is an urgent need to develop a computational approach to predict APPs on a large scale. In this study, we provided a computational method, termed PredAPP (Prediction of Anti-Parasitic Peptides) that could effectively identify APPs using an ensemble of well-performed machine learning (ML) classifiers. Firstly, to solve the class imbalance problem, a balanced training dataset was generated by the undersampling method. We found that the balanced dataset based on cluster centroid achieved the best performance. Then, nine groups of features and six ML algorithms were combined to generate 54 classifiers and the output of these classifiers formed 54 feature representations, and in each feature group, we selected the feature representation with best performance for classification. Finally, the selected feature representations were integrated using logistic regression algorithm to construct the prediction model PredAPP. On the independent dataset, PredAPP achieved accuracy and AUC of 0.880 and 0.922, respectively, compared to 0.739 and 0.873 of AMPfun, a state-of-the-art method to predict APPs. The web server of PredAPP is freely accessible at http://predapp.xialab.info and https://github.com/xialab-ahu/PredAPP. Graphic Abstract: [Figure not available: see fulltext.]",,,,,,,,,,,,None

deepprog,lanagarmire,DeepProg,"however, these are difficult to integrate computationally. We introduce DeepProg, a novel ensemble framework of deep-learning and machine-learning approaches that robustly predicts patient survival subtypes using multi-omics data. It identifies two optimal survival subtypes in most cancers and yields significantly better risk-stratification than other multi-omics integration methods. DeepProg is highly predictive, exemplified by two liver cancer (C-index 0.73–0.80) and five breast cancer datasets (C-index 0.68–0.73). Pan-cancer analysis associates common genomic signatures in poor survival subtypes with extracellular matrix modeling, immune deregulation, and mitosis processes.

LinX,KukackaZ,LinX,"© 2020 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.Chemical cross-linking mass spectrometry has become a popular tool in structural biology. Although several algorithms exist that efficiently analyze data-dependent mass spectrometric data, the algorithm to identify and quantify intermolecular cross-links located at the interaction interface of homodimer molecules was missing. The algorithm in LinX utilizes high mass accuracy for ion identification. In contrast with standard data-dependent analysis, LinX enables the elucidation of cross-linked peptides originating from the interaction interface of homodimers labeled by 14N/15N, including their ratio or cross-links from protein-nucleic acid complexes. The software is written in Java language, and its source code and a detailed user's guide are freely available at https://github.com/KukackaZ/LinX or https://ms-utils.org/LinX. Data are accessible via the ProteomeXchange server with the data set identifier PXD023522.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,4.0,0.0,,Emerging

sol_genomics_network,,,"http:// solgenomics.net/) is a clade-oriented database (COD) containing biological data for species in the Solanaceae and their close relatives, with data types ranging from chromosomes and genes to phenotypes and accessions. SGN hosts several genome maps and sequences, including a pre-release of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum cv Heinz 1706) reference genome. A new transcriptome component has been added to store RNA-seq and microarray data. SGN is also an open source software project, continuously developing and improving a complex system for storing, integrating and analyzing data. All code and development work is publicly visible on GitHub (http://github.com). The database architecture combines SGN-specific schemas and the community-developed Chado schema (http://gmod.org/wiki/Chado) for compatibility with other genome databases. The SGN curation model is community-driven, allowing researchers to add and edit information using simple web tools. Currently, over a hundred community annotators help curate the database. SGN can be accessed at http://solgenomics.net/. © The Author(s) 2010.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

chembench,alvesvm,"sars-cov-mpro),","© 2020 Wiley-VCH GmbHThe main protease (Mpro) of the SARS-CoV-2 has been proposed as one of the major drug targets for COVID-19. We have identified the experimental data on the inhibitory activity of compounds tested against the closely related (96 % sequence identity, 100 % active site conservation) Mpro of SARS-CoV. We developed QSAR models of these inhibitors and employed these models for virtual screening of all drugs in the DrugBank database. Similarity searching and molecular docking were explored in parallel, but docking failed to correctly discriminate between experimentally active and inactive compounds, so it was not relied upon for prospective virtual screening. Forty-two compounds were identified by our models as consensus computational hits. Subsequent to our computational studies, NCATS reported the results of experimental screening of their drug collection in SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect assay (https://opendata.ncats.nih.gov/covid19/). Coincidentally, NCATS tested 11 of our 42 hits, and three of them, cenicriviroc (AC50 of 8.9 μM), proglumetacin (tested twice independently, with AC50 of 8.9 μM and 12.5 μM), and sufugolix (AC50 12.6 μM), were shown to be active. These observations support the value of our modeling approaches and models for guiding the experimental investigations of putative anti-COVID-19 drug candidates. All data and models used in this study are publicly available via Supplementary Materials, GitHub (https://github.com/alvesvm/sars-cov-mpro), and Chembench web portal (https://chembench.mml.unc.edu/).",,,,,,,,,,,,None

ensembl,,,"© The Author(s) 2014.Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org) is a genomic interpretation system providing the most up-to-date annotations, querying tools and access methods for chordates and key model organisms. This year we released updated annotation (gene models, comparative genomics, regulatory regions and variation) on the new human assembly, GRCh38, although we continue to support researchers using the GRCh37.p13 assembly through a dedicated site (http://grch37. ensembl.org). Our Regulatory Build has been revamped to identify regulatory regions of interest and to efficiently highlight their activity across disparate epigenetic data sets. A number of new interfaces allow users to perform large-scale comparisons of their data against our annotations. The REST server (http://rest.ensembl.org), which allows programs written in any language to query our databases, has moved to a full service alongside our upgraded website tools. Our online Variant Effect Predictor tool has been updated to process more variants and calculate summary statistics. Lastly, the WiggleTools package enables users to summarize large collections of data sets and view them as single tracks in Ensembl. The Ensembl code base itself is more accessible: it is now hosted on our GitHub organization page (https://github.com/Ensembl) under an Apache 2.0 open source license.",,,,,,,,,,,,Mature

brainpainter,mrazvan22,brain-coloring,"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.We present BrainPainter, a software that automatically generates images of highlighted brain structures given a list of numbers corresponding to the output colours of each region. Compared to existing visualisation software (i.e. Freesurfer, SPM, 3D Slicer), BrainPainter has three key advantages: (1) it does not require the input data to be in a specialised format, allowing BrainPainter to be used in combination with any neuroimaging analysis tools, (2) it can visualise both cortical and subcortical structures and (3) it can be used to generate movies showing dynamic processes, e.g. propagation of pathology on the brain. We highlight three use cases where BrainPainter was used in existing neuroimaging studies: (1) visualisation of the degree of atrophy through interpolation along a user-defined gradient of colours, (2) visualisation of the progression of pathology in Alzheimer’s disease as well as (3) visualisation of pathology in subcortical regions in Huntington’s disease. Moreover, through the design of BrainPainter we demonstrate the possibility of using a powerful 3D computer graphics engine such as Blender to generate brain visualisations for the neuroscience community. Blender’s capabilities, e.g. particle simulations, motion graphics, UV unwrapping, raster graphics editing, raytracing and illumination effects, open a wealth of possibilities for brain visualisation not available in current neuroimaging software. BrainPainter (Source code: https://github.com/mrazvan22/brain-coloring ) is customisable, easy to use, and can run straight from the web browser: http://brainpainter.csail.mit.edu. It can be used to visualise biomarker data from any brain imaging modality, or simply to highlight a particular brain structure for e.g. anatomy courses.",70.0,70.0,2.0,19.0,7.0,19.0,4.0,0.0,116.0,4.0,36.31,None

phewas-me,tbilab,multimorbidity_explorer).,"© The Author(s) 2020. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.SUMMARY: Electronic health records (EHRs) linked with a DNA biobank provide unprecedented opportunities for biomedical research in precision medicine. The Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) is a widely used technique for the evaluation of relationships between genetic variants and a large collection of clinical phenotypes recorded in EHRs. PheWAS analyses are typically presented as static tables and charts of summary statistics obtained from statistical tests of association between a genetic variant and individual phenotypes. Comorbidities are common and typically lead to complex, multivariate gene-disease association signals that are challenging to interpret. Discovering and interrogating multimorbidity patterns and their influence in PheWAS is difficult and time-consuming. We present PheWAS-ME: an interactive dashboard to visualize individual-level genotype and phenotype data side-by-side with PheWAS analysis results, allowing researchers to explore multimorbidity patterns and their associations with a genetic variant of interest. We expect this application to enrich PheWAS analyses by illuminating clinical multimorbidity patterns present in the data. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: A demo PheWAS-ME application is publicly available at https://prod.tbilab.org/phewas_me/. Sample datasets are provided for exploration with the option to upload custom PheWAS results and corresponding individual-level data. Online versions of the appendices are available at https://prod.tbilab.org/phewas_me_info/. The source code is available as an R package on GitHub (https://github.com/tbilab/multimorbidity_explorer). SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

PhySpeTree,yangfangs,physpetools,"PhySpeTree prepares complex configure files for different software, then automatically downloads genomic data, cleans sequences, and builds trees. PhySpeTree allows users to perform critical steps such as sequence alignment and tree construction by adjusting advanced options. PhySpeTree provides two parallel pipelines based on concatenated highly conserved proteins and small subunit ribosomal RNA sequences, respectively. Accessory modules, such as those for inserting new species, generating visualization configurations, and combining trees, are distributed along with PhySpeTree. Conclusions: Together with accessory modules, PhySpeTree significantly simplifies tree reconstruction. PhySpeTree is implemented in Python running on modern operating systems (Linux, macOS, and Windows).

benmap,epa-kpc,RFMEVAL),"these latter models make simplifying assumptions about the emissions-to-air quality relationship as a means of reducing the computational time needed to simulate air quality. This manuscript presents a new database of photochemical- and reduced complexity-modelled changes in annual average particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm and associated health effects and economic values for five case studies representing different emissions control scenarios. The research community is developing an increasing number of reduced complexity models as lower-cost and more expeditious alternatives to full form Eulerian photochemical grid models such as the Comprehensive Air-Quality Model with eXtensions (CAMx) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. A comprehensive evaluation of reduced complexity models can demonstrate the extent to which these tools capture complex chemical and physical processes when representing emission control options. Systematically comparing reduced complexity model predictions to benchmarks from photochemical grid models requires a consistent set of input parameters across all systems. Developing such inputs is resource intensive and consequently the data that we have developed and shared (https://github.com/epa-kpc/RFMEVAL) provide a valuable resource for others to evaluate reduced complexity models. The dataset includes inputs and outputs representing 5 emission control scenarios, including sector-based regulatory policy scenarios focused on on-road mobile sources and electrical generating units (EGUs) as well as hypothetical across-the-board reductions to emissions from cement kilns, refineries, and pulp and paper facilities. Model inputs, outputs, and run control files are provided for the Air Pollution Emission Experiments and Policy Analysis (APEEP) version 2 and 3, Intervention Model for Air Pollution (InMAP), Estimating Air pollution Social Impact Using Regression (EASIUR), and EPA's source apportionment benefit-per-ton reduced complexity models. For comparison, photochemical grid model annual average PM2.5 output is provided for each emission scenario. Further, inputs are also provided for the Environmental Benefits and Mapping Community Edition (BenMAP-CE) tool to generate county level health benefits and monetized health damages along with output files for benchmarking and intercomparison. Monetized health impacts are also provided from EASIUR and APEEP which can provide these outside the BenMAP-CE framework. The database will allow researchers to more easily compare reduced complexity model predictions against photochemical grid model predictions.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

tools-taggi,lefeverde,Mr_Demuxy,"Copyright 2019 Glenn et al.Next-generation sequencing (NGS) of amplicons is used in a wide variety of contexts. In many cases, NGS amplicon sequencing remains overly expensive and inflexible, with library preparation strategies relying upon the fusion of locus-specific primers to full-length adapter sequences with a single identifying sequence or ligating adapters onto PCR products. In Adapterama I, we presented universal stubs and primers to produce thousands of unique index combinations and a modifiable system for incorporating them into Illumina libraries. Here, we describe multiple ways to use the Adapterama system and other approaches for amplicon sequencing on Illumina instruments. In the variant we use most frequently for large-scale projects, we fuse partial adapter sequences (TruSeq or Nextera) onto the 50 end of locus-specific PCR primers with variable-length tag sequences between the adapter and locus-specific sequences. These fusion primers can be used combinatorially to amplify samples within a 96-well plate (8 forward primers + 12 reverse primers yield 8×12 = 96 combinations), and the resulting amplicons can be pooled. The initial PCR products then serve as template for a second round of PCR with dual-indexed iTru or iNext primers (also used combinatorially) to make full-length libraries. The resulting quadruple-indexed amplicons have diversity at most base positions and can be pooled with any standard Illumina library for sequencing. The number of sequencing reads from the amplicon pools can be adjusted, facilitating deep sequencing when required or reducing sequencing costs per sample to an economically trivial amount when deep coverage is not needed. We demonstrate the utility and versatility of our approaches with results from six projects using different implementations of our protocols. Thus, we show that these methods facilitate amplicon library construction for Illumina instruments at reduced cost with increased flexibility. A simple web page to design fusion primers compatible with iTru primers is available at: http://baddna.uga.edu/tools-taggi.html. A fast and easy to use program to demultiplex amplicon pools with internal indexes is available at: https://github.com/lefeverde/Mr_Demuxy.",8.0,8.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,,,0.0,12.0,0.0,633.28,None

TEs,SNAnderson,maizeTE_variation,"© 2019 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2019 John Wiley & Sons LtdTransposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous components of eukaryotic genomes and can create variation in genome organization and content. Most maize genomes are composed of TEs. We developed an approach to define shared and variable TE insertions across genome assemblies and applied this method to four maize genomes (B73, W22, Mo17 and PH207) with uniform structural annotations of TEs. Among these genomes we identified approximately 400 000 TEs that are polymorphic, encompassing 1.6 Gb of variable TE sequence. These polymorphic TEs include a combination of recent transposition events as well as deletions of older TEs. There are examples of polymorphic TEs within each of the superfamilies of TEs and they are found distributed across the genome, including in regions of recent shared ancestry among individuals. There are many examples of polymorphic TEs within or near maize genes. In addition, there are 2380 gene annotations in the B73 genome that are located within variable TEs, providing evidence for the role of TEs in contributing to the substantial differences in annotated gene content among these genotypes. TEs are highly variable in our survey of four temperate maize genomes, highlighting the major contribution of TEs in driving variation in genome organization and gene content.

lobstahs,vanmooylipidomics,LOBSTAHS,"the default databases contain 14 068 unique entries. To demonstrate the software's functionality, we screened more than 340 000 mass spectral features from an experiment in which hydrogen peroxide was used to induce oxidative stress in the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum. LOBSTAHS putatively identified 1969 unique parent compounds in 21 869 features that survived the multistage screening process. While P. tricornutum maintained more than 92% of its core lipidome under oxidative stress, patterns in biomarker distribution and abundance indicated remodeling was both subtle and pervasive. Treatment with 150 μM H2O2 promoted statistically significant carbon-chain elongation across lipid classes, with the strongest elongation accompanying oxidation in moieties of monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, a lipid typically localized to the chloroplast. Oxidative stress also induced a pronounced reallocation of lipidome peak area to triacylglycerols. LOBSTAHS can be used with environmental or experimental data from a variety of systems and is freely available at https://github.com/vanmooylipidomics/LOBSTAHS.",8.0,8.0,10.0,12.0,12.0,12.0,18.0,13.0,717.0,5.0,303.798,None

gprotpred,vkostiou,GprotPRED,"© 2016 Elsevier B.V.Heterotrimeric G-proteins form a major protein family, which participates in signal transduction. They are composed of three subunits, Gα, Gβ and Gγ. The Gα subunit is further divided in four distinct families Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11 and G12/13. The goal of this work was to detect and classify members of the four distinct families, plus the Gβ and the Gγ subunits of G-proteins from sequence alone. To achieve this purpose, six specific profile Hidden Markov Models (pHMMs) were built and checked for their credibility. These models were then applied to ten (10) proteomes and were able to identify all known G-protein and classify them into the distinct families. In a separate case study, the models were applied to twenty seven (27) arthropod proteomes and were able to give more credible classification in proteins with uncertain annotation and in some cases to detect novel proteins. An online tool, GprotPRED, was developed that uses these six pHMMs. The sensitivity and specificity for all pHMMs were equal to 100% with the exception of the Gβ case, where sensitivity equals to 100%, while specificity is 99.993%. In contrast to Pfam's pHMM which detects Gα subunits in general, our method not only detects Gα subunits but also classifies them into the appropriate Gα-protein family and thus could become a useful tool for the annotation of G-proteins in newly discovered proteomes. GprotPRED online tool is publicly available for non-commercial use at http://bioinformatics.biol.uoa.gr/GprotPRED and, also, a standalone version of the tool at https://github.com/vkostiou/GprotPRED.",0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,11.0,0.0,,None

gsca,zji90,GSCA.,"© The Author(s) 2015. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.Gene Set Context Analysis (GSCA) is an open source software package to help researchers use massive amounts of publicly available gene expression data (PED) to make discoveries. Users can interactively visualize and explore gene and gene set activities in 25,000+ consistently normalized human and mouse gene expression samples representing diverse biological contexts (e.g. different cells, tissues and disease types, etc.). By providing one or multiple genes or gene sets as input and specifying a gene set activity pattern of interest, users can query the expression compendium to systematically identify biological contexts associated with the specified gene set activity pattern. In this way, researchers with new gene sets from their own experiments may discover previously unknown contexts of gene set functions and hence increase the value of their experiments. GSCA has a graphical user interface (GUI). The GUI makes the analysis convenient and customizable. Analysis results can be conveniently exported as publication quality figures and tables. GSCA is available at https://github.com/zji90/GSCA. This software significantly lowers the bar for biomedical investigators to use PED in their daily research for generating and screening hypotheses, which was previously difficult because of the complexity, heterogeneity and size of the data.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

grcalculator,,,"BACKGROUND: Quantifying the response of cell lines to drugs or other perturbagens is the cornerstone of pre-clinical drug development and pharmacogenomics as well as a means to study factors that contribute to sensitivity and resistance. In dividing cells, traditional metrics derived from dose-response curves such as IC 50 , AUC, and E max , are confounded by the number of cell divisions taking place during the assay, which varies widely for biological and experimental reasons. Hafner et al. (Nat Meth 13:521-627, 2016) recently proposed an alternative way to quantify drug response, normalized growth rate (GR) inhibition, that is robust to such confounders. Adoption of the GR method is expected to improve the reproducibility of dose-response assays and the reliability of pharmacogenomic associations (Hafner et al. 500-502, 2017).RESULTS: We describe here an interactive website ( www.grcalculator.org ) for calculation, analysis, and visualization of dose-response data using the GR approach and for comparison of GR and traditional metrics. Data can be user-supplied or derived from published datasets. The web tools are implemented in the form of three integrated Shiny applications (grcalculator, grbrowser, and grtutorial) deployed through a Shiny server. Intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) allow for interactive analysis and visualization of data. The Shiny applications make use of two R packages (shinyLi and GRmetrics) specifically developed for this purpose. The GRmetrics R package is also available via Bioconductor and can be used for offline data analysis and visualization. Source code for the Shiny applications and associated packages (shinyLi and GRmetrics) can be accessed at www.github.com/uc-bd2k/grcalculator and www.github.com/datarail/gr_metrics .CONCLUSIONS: GRcalculator is a powerful, user-friendly, and free tool to facilitate analysis of dose-response data. It generates publication-ready figures and provides a unified platform for investigators to analyze dose-response data across diverse cell types and perturbagens (including drugs, biological ligands, RNAi, etc.). GRcalculator also provides access to data collected by the NIH LINCS Program ( http://www.lincsproject.org /) and other public domain datasets. The GRmetrics Bioconductor package provides computationally trained users with a platform for offline analysis of dose-response data and facilitates inclusion of GR metrics calculations within existing R analysis pipelines.

netsmooth,BIMSBbioinfo,netSmooth,"© 2018 Ronen J and Akalin A.Single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) experiments suffer from a range of characteristic technical biases, such as dropouts (zero or near zero counts) and high variance. Current analysis methods rely on imputing missing values by various means of local averaging or regression, often amplifying biases inherent in the data. We present netSmooth, a network-diffusion based method that uses priors for the covariance structure of gene expression profiles on scRNA-seq experiments in order to smooth expression values. We demonstrate that netSmooth improves clustering results of scRNA-seq experiments from distinct cell populations, time-course experiments, and cancer genomics. We provide an R package for our method, available at: https://github.com/BIMSBbioinfo/netSmooth.",28.0,28.0,13.0,6.0,5.0,6.0,11.0,1.0,218.0,5.0,28.264,None

graftm,geronimp,"graftM_gpkgs),","Large-scale metagenomic datasets enable the recovery of hundreds of population genomes from environmental samples. However, these genomes do not typically represent the full diversity of complex microbial communities. Gene-centric approaches can be used to gain a comprehensive view of diversity by examining each read independently, but traditional pairwise comparison approaches typically over-classify taxonomy and scale poorly with increasing metagenome and database sizes. Here we introduce GraftM, a tool that uses gene specific packages to rapidly identify gene families in metagenomic data using hidden Markov models (HMMs) or DIAMOND databases, and classifies these sequences using placement into pre-constructed gene trees. The speed and accuracy of GraftM was benchmarked with in silico and in vitro mock communities using taxonomic markers, and was found to have higher accuracy at the family level with a processing time 2.0-3.7× faster than currently available software. Exploration of a wetland metagenome using 16S rRNA- and methyl-coenzyme M reductase (McrA)-specific gpkgs revealed taxonomic and functional shifts across a depth gradient. Analysis of the NCBI nr database using the McrA gpkg allowed the detection of novel sequences belonging to phylum-level lineages. A growing collection of gpkgs is available online (https://github.com/geronimp/graftM_gpkgs), where curated packages can be uploaded and exchanged.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

stpm,izhbannikov,spm,"however, there are no publicly available software tools that implement this methodology. Results: We developed an R package stpm for the SPM-methodology. The package estimates several versions of SPM currently available in the literature including discrete- and continuous-time multidimensional models and a one-dimensional model with time-dependent parameters. Also, the package provides tools for simulation and projection of individual trajectories and hazard functions. Conclusion: In this paper, we present the first software implementation of the SPM-methodology by providing an R package stpm, which was verified through extensive simulation and validation studies. Future work includes further improvements of the model. Clinical and academic researchers will benefit from using the presented model and software.

gene2drug,franapoli,gep2pep.,"© The Author(s) 2017. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved. For Permissions, please e-mail: journals.permissions@oup.com.Motivation Drug repositioning has been proposed as an effective shortcut to drug discovery. The availability of large collections of transcriptional responses to drugs enables computational approaches to drug repositioning directly based on measured molecular effects. Results We introduce a novel computational methodology for rational drug repositioning, which exploits the transcriptional responses following treatment with small molecule. Specifically, given a therapeutic target gene, a prioritization of potential effective drugs is obtained by assessing their impact on the transcription of genes in the pathway(s) including the target. We performed in silico validation and comparison with a state-of-art technique based on similar principles. We next performed experimental validation in two different real-case drug repositioning scenarios: (i) upregulation of the glutamate-pyruvate transaminase (GPT), which has been shown to induce reduction of oxalate levels in a mouse model of primary hyperoxaluria, and (ii) activation of the transcription factor TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis and autophagy, whose modulation may be beneficial in neurodegenerative disorders.

smallgenometools,DrTrevorBell,SmallGenomeTools,"licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.DNA sequence analysis is undertaken in many biological research laboratories. The workflow consists of several steps involving the bioinformatic processing of biological data. We have developed a suite of web-based online bioinformatic tools to assist with processing, analysis and curation of DNA sequence data. Most of these tools are genome-agnostic, with two tools specifically designed for hepatitis B virus sequence data. Tools in the suite are able to process sequence data from Sanger sequencing, ultra-deep amplicon resequencing (pyrosequencing) and chromatograph (trace files), as appropriate. The tools are available online at no cost and are aimed at researchers without specialist technical computer knowledge. The tools can be accessed at http://hvdr.bioinf.wits.ac.za/SmallGenomeTools, and the source code is available online at https://github.com/DrTrevorBell/SmallGenomeTools.",1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,236.545,None

defume,,,"© 2015 van der Helm et al.Background: Functional metagenomic selections represent a powerful technique that is widely applied for identification of novel genes from complex metagenomic sources. However, whereas hundreds to thousands of clones can be easily generated and sequenced over a few days of experiments, analyzing the data is time consuming and constitutes a major bottleneck for experimental researchers in the field. Findings: Here we present the deFUME web server, an easy-to-use web-based interface for processing, annotation and visualization of functional metagenomics sequencing data, tailored to meet the requirements of non-bioinformaticians. The web-server integrates multiple analysis steps into one single workflow: read assembly, open reading frame prediction, and annotation with BLAST, InterPro and GO classifiers. Analysis results are visualized in an online dynamic web-interface. Conclusion: The deFUME webserver provides a fast track from raw sequence to a comprehensive visual data overview that facilitates effortless inspection of gene function, clustering and distribution. The webserver is available at cbs.dtu.dk/services/deFUME/and the source code is distributed at github.com/EvdH0/deFUME.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

gobyweb,CampagneLaboratory,gobyweb2-plugins.,"We present GobyWeb, a web-based system that facilitates the management and analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) projects. The software provides integrated support for a broad set of HTS analyses and offers a simple plugin extension mechanism. Analyses currently supported include quantification of gene expression for messenger and small RNA sequencing, estimation of DNA methylation (i.e., reduced bisulfite sequencing and whole genome methyl-seq), or the detection of pathogens in sequenced data. In contrast to previous analysis pipelines developed for analysis of HTS data, GobyWeb requires significantly less storage space, runs analyses efficiently on a parallel grid, scales gracefully to process tens or hundreds of multi-gigabyte samples, yet can be used effectively by researchers who are comfortable using a web browser. We conducted performance evaluations of the software and found it to either outperform or have similar performance to analysis programs developed for specialized analyses of HTS data. We found that most biologists who took a one-hour GobyWeb training session were readily able to analyze RNA-Seq data with state of the art analysis tools. GobyWeb can be obtained at http://gobyweb.campagnelab and is freely available for non-commercial use.

pbrowse,VCCRI,PBrowse,"© 2017 The Author(s).Genome browsers are widely used for individually exploring various types of genomic data. A handful of genome browsers offer limited tools for collaboration among multiple users. Here, we describe PBrowse, an integrated real-time collaborative genome browser that enables multiple users to simultaneously view and access genomic data, thereby harnessing the wisdom of the crowd. PBrowse is based on the Dalliance genome browser and has a re-designed user and data management system with novel collaborative functionalities, including real-time collaborative view, track comment and an integrated group chat feature. Through the Distributed Annotation Server protocol, PBrowse can easily access a wide range of publicly available genomic data, such as the ENCODE data sets. We argue that PBrowse represents a paradigm shift from using a genome browser as a static data visualization tool to a platform that enables real-time human–human interaction and knowledge exchange in a collaborative setting. PBrowse is available at http://pbrowse.victorchang.edu.au, and its source code is available via an open source BSD 3 license at http://github.com/VCCRI/PBrowse.",5.0,5.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,8.0,4.0,,None

webgivi,sunliang3361,WebGIVI.,"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: A major challenge of high throughput transcriptome studies is presenting the data to researchers in an interpretable format. In many cases, the outputs of such studies are gene lists which are then examined for enriched biological concepts. One approach to help the researcher interpret large gene datasets is to associate genes and informative terms (iTerm) that are obtained from the biomedical literature using the eGIFT text-mining system. However, examining large lists of iTerm and gene pairs is a daunting task. Results: We have developed WebGIVI, an interactive web-based visualization tool ( http://raven.anr.udel.edu/webgivi/ ) to explore gene:iTerm pairs. WebGIVI was built via Cytoscape and Data Driven Document JavaScript libraries and can be used to relate genes to iTerms and then visualize gene and iTerm pairs. WebGIVI can accept a gene list that is used to retrieve the gene symbols and corresponding iTerm list. This list can be submitted to visualize the gene iTerm pairs using two distinct methods: a Concept Map or a Cytoscape Network Map. In addition, WebGIVI also supports uploading and visualization of any two-column tab separated data. Conclusions: WebGIVI provides an interactive and integrated network graph of gene and iTerms that allows filtering, sorting, and grouping, which can aid biologists in developing hypothesis based on the input gene lists. In addition, WebGIVI can visualize hundreds of nodes and generate a high-resolution image that is important for most of research publications. The source code can be freely downloaded at https://github.com/sunliang3361/WebGIVI. The WebGIVI tutorial is available at http://raven.anr.udel.edu/webgivi/tutorial.php.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

sbmlmod,MolecularBioinformatics,sbml-mod-ws.,"© 2017 The Author(s).Background: Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is the standard model representation and description language in systems biology. Enriching and analysing systems biology models by integrating the multitude of available data, increases the predictive power of these models. This may be a daunting task, which commonly requires bioinformatic competence and scripting. Results: We present SBMLmod, a Python-based web application and service, that automates integration of high throughput data into SBML models. Subsequent steady state analysis is readily accessible via the web service COPASIWS. We illustrate the utility of SBMLmod by integrating gene expression data from different healthy tissues as well as from a cancer dataset into a previously published model of mammalian tryptophan metabolism. Conclusion: SBMLmod is a user-friendly platform for model modification and simulation. The web application is available at http://sbmlmod.uit.no , whereas the WSDL definition file for the web service is accessible via http://sbmlmod.uit.no/SBMLmod.wsdl. Furthermore, the entire package can be downloaded from https://github.com/MolecularBioinformatics/sbml-mod-ws. We envision that SBMLmod will make automated model modification and simulation available to a broader research community.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

revecor,yiluheihei,shiny-RevEcoR,"© 2016 Cao et al.Background: All species live in complex ecosystems. The structure and complexity of a microbial community reflects not only diversity and function, but also the environment in which it occurs. However, traditional ecological methods can only be applied on a small scale and for relatively well-understood biological systems. Recently, a graph-theory-based algorithm called the reverse ecology approach has been developed that can analyze the metabolic networks of all the species in a microbial community, and predict the metabolic interface between species and their environment. Results: Here, we present RevEcoR, an R package and a Shiny Web application that implements the reverse ecology algorithm for determining microbe-microbe interactions in microbial communities. This software allows users to obtain large-scale ecological insights into species' ecology directly from high-throughput metagenomic data. The software has great potential for facilitating the study of microbiomes. Conclusions: RevEcoR is open source software for the study of microbial community ecology. The RevEcoR R package is freely available under the GNU General Public License v. 2.0 at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RevEcoR/with the vignette and typical usage examples, and the interactive Shiny web application is available at http://yiluheihei.shinyapps.io/shiny-RevEcoR, or can be installed locally with the source code accessed from https://github.com/yiluheihei/shiny-RevEcoR.",3.0,3.0,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.0,0.0,5.0,0.0,,None

azahar,agustinaarroyuelo,Azahar,"© 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.Glycans are key molecules in many physiological and pathological processes. As with other molecules, like proteins, visualization of the 3D structures of glycans adds valuable information for understanding their biological function. Hence, here we introduce Azahar, a computing environment for the creation, visualization and analysis of glycan molecules. Azahar is implemented in Python and works as a plugin for the well known PyMOL package (Schrodinger in The PyMOL molecular graphics system, version 1.3r1, 2010). Besides the already available visualization and analysis options provided by PyMOL, Azahar includes 3 cartoon-like representations and tools for 3D structure caracterization such as a comformational search using a Monte Carlo with minimization routine and also tools to analyse single glycans or trajectories/ensembles including the calculation of radius of gyration, Ramachandran plots and hydrogen bonds. Azahar is freely available to download from http://www.pymolwiki.org/index.php/Azahar and the source code is available at https://github.com/agustinaarroyuelo/Azahar.",8.0,8.0,3.0,6.0,1.0,6.0,4.0,6.0,123.0,10.0,135.009,None

kinmutrf,Rbbt-Workflows,KinMut2.,"and c) at the residue level, the types of amino acids involved, changes in biochemical properties, functional annotations from UniProt, Phospho.ELM and FireDB. KinMutRF identifies disease-associated variants satisfactorily (Acc: 0.88, Prec:0.82, Rec:0.75, F-score:0.78, MCC:0.68) when trained and cross-validated with the 3689 human kinase variants from UniProt that have been annotated as neutral or pathogenic. All unclassified variants were excluded from the training set. Furthermore, KinMutRF is discussed with respect to two independent kinase-specific sets of mutations no included in the training and testing, Kin-Driver (643 variants) and Pon-BTK (1495 variants). Moreover, we provide predictions for the 848 protein kinase variants in UniProt that remained unclassified. A public implementation of KinMutRF, including documentation and examples, is available online ( http://kinmut2.bioinfo.cnio.es ). The source code for local installation is released under a GPL version 3 license, and can be downloaded from https://github.com/Rbbt-Workflows/KinMut2. Conclusions: KinMutRF is capable of classifying kinase variation with good performance. Predictions by KinMutRF compare favorably in a benchmark with other state-of-the-art methods (i.e. SIFT, Polyphen-2, MutationAssesor, MutationTaster, LRT, CADD, FATHMM, and VEST). Kinase-specific features rank as the most elucidatory in terms of information gain and are likely the improvement in prediction performance. This advocates for the development of family-specific classifiers able to exploit the discriminatory power of features unique to individual protein families.",,,,,,,,,,,,None

merp,py-merp,py-merp.,"© The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Summary: We present a Mendelian randomization (MR) pipeline (MeRP) to facilitate rapid, causal inference analysis through automating key steps in developing and analyzing genetic instruments obtained from publicly available data. Our tool uses the National Human Genome Research Institute catalog of associations to generate instrumental variable trait files and provides methods for filtering of potential confounding associations as well as linkage disequilibrium. MeRP generates estimated causal effect scores via a MR-score analysis using summary data for disease endpoints typically found in the public domain. We utilize our pipeline to develop genetic instruments for seven traits and evaluate potential causal relationships with two disease endpoints, observing two putatively causal associations between blood pressure and bone-mineral density with type 2 diabetes. Our tool emphasizes the importance of careful but systematic screening of large datasets for discovery and systematic follow-up. Availability and implementation: MeRP is a free, open-source project and can be downloaded at http://github.com/py-merp/py-merp. Complete documentation can be found at http://py-merp.github.io.

bisque,hyulab,BISQUE,"© 2016 The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.Summary: Biological sequence databases are integral to efforts to characterize and understand biological molecules and share biological data. However, when analyzing these data, scientists are often left holding disparate biological currency - molecular identifiers from different databases. For downstream applications that require converting the identifiers themselves, there are many resources available, but analyzing associated loci and variants can be cumbersome if data is not given in a form amenable to particular analyses. Here we present BISQUE, a web server and customizable command-line tool for converting molecular identifiers and their contained loci and variants between different database conventions. BISQUE uses a graph traversal algorithm to generalize the conversion process for residues in the human genome, genes, transcripts and proteins, allowing for conversion across classes of molecules and in all directions through an intuitive web interface and a URL-based web service. Availability and implementation: BISQUE is freely available via the web using any major web browser (http://bisque.yulab.org/). Source code is available in a public GitHub repository (https://github.com/hyulab/BISQUE).",5.0,5.0,4.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,1.0,0.0,3.0,0.0,,None
